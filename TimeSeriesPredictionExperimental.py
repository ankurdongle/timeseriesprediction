#use adagrad to minimize with .3 learning rate
#minimize it with adagrad, not SGD
#One downside of SGD is that it is sensitive to
#the learning rate hyper-parameter. When the data are sparse and features have
#different frequencies, a single learning rate for every weight update can have
#exponential regret.
#Some features can be extremely useful and informative to an optimization problem but 
#they may not show up in most of the training instances or data. If, when they do show up, 
#they are weighted equally in terms of learning rate as a feature that has shown up hundreds 
#of times we are practically saying that the influence of such features means nothing in the 
#overall optimization. it's impact per step in the stochastic gradient descent will be so small 
#that it can practically be discounted). To counter this, AdaGrad makes it such that features 
#that are more sparse in the data have a higher learning rate which translates into a larger 
#update for that feature
#sparse features can be very useful.
#Each feature has a different learning rate which is adaptable. 
#gives voice to the little guy who matters a lot
#weights that receive high gradients will have their effective learning rate reduced, 
#while weights that receive small or infrequent updates will have their effective learning rate increased.
